# PROJECT PROPOSAL: Early Diabetes Risk Assessment

**Assignment:** DSCD 611 Final Project Proposal  
**Course:** DSCD 611: Programming for Data Scientists I  
**Group:** Group B15  
**Institution:** Department of Computer Science, University of Ghana – Legon  
**Instructors:** Clifford Broni-Bediako and Michael Soli  
**Date:** 14th November 2025  

**Topic:** Predictive Modeling for Type 2 Diabetes Melitus in Pima Indian Populations

## 1. Topic to be Studied
This project investigates the use of **Supervised Machine Learning** to solve a **Binary Classification** problem: predicting the onset of Type 2 Diabetes Melitus. We will analyze metabolic markers like glucose and BMI in a specific demographic of Pima Indian women to distinguish between 'Healthy' and 'Diabetic' outcomes.

## 2. What is Known of the Topic
Type 2 diabetes is often asymptomatic in its early stages. Known risk factors include obesity, age, and high blood sugar. The Pima Indian population historically suffers from high rates of diabetes due to a combination of genetic and rapid lifestyle transitions.

## 3. Importance and Relevance
Early diagnosis is the single most effective way to prevent debilitating complications such as neuropathy and kidney failure. A data-driven screening tool is highly important for rural or low-resource communities where access to full endocrinology clinics is limited.

## 4. Description of Data
We will use the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** (768 samples, 8 medical features). The data includes variables such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age.

## 5. Expected Results and Impact
We expect to develop a model (likely ensemble-based) that can achieve >75% accuracy in predicting diabetes risk. The impact will be a "proof-of-concept" for an automated screening pipeline that can be used by community health workers to prioritize high-risk patients.

## 6. Project Plan and Team Roles
- **Execution Strategy:** We will use the CRISP-DM methodology: Data Understanding -> Cleaning -> Preprocessing -> Modeling -> Evaluation.
- **Edward Tsatsu Akorlie (Leader):** Project coordination and lead modeling.
- **Daniel Kpakpo Adotey:** Data cleaning and ingestion.
- **Kwame Ofori-Gyau:** Statistical analysis and research.
- **Francis Aboraa Sarbeng:** Data visualization and EDA.
- **Caleb Abakah Mensah:** Documentation, reporting, and slides.
